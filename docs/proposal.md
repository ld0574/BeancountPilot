# Capstone Proposal

## Problem Statement

In the contemporary digital economy, individuals and small business operators are inundated with financial transactions across multiple platforms, from traditional banking interfaces to mobile payment applications like Alipay and WeChat Pay. While tools such as Beancount offer a powerful, double-entry accounting framework for achieving precise financial clarity and control, a significant adoption barrier persists (Blais, 2016). The core challenge lies not in data acquisition, as most institutions provide downloadable structured records, but in the subsequent cognitive labor of transaction categorization. For instance, a single monthly export from a commercial bank may contain hundreds of entries with cryptic or abbreviated payee descriptions such as "Tenpay-Mt.Tuan" or "Alipay-Starbucks". The user must manually interpret each entry, deciding whether a Starbucks transaction represents a personal "Expenses:Food:Dining" or a business-related "Expenses:Business:Entertainment". This process is inherently time-consuming, prone to subjective error, and often cited as the primary reason for abandoning meticulous financial tracking. It represents a critical gap between readily available structured financial data and semantically meaningful, actionable accounting intelligence. This challenge has been validated that the effectiveness of large-scale personalized categorization systems using machine learning to automate financial transaction classification, highlighting both the technical feasibility and real-world demand for solutions in this domain (Lesner et al., 2019). This gap necessitates a manual, error-prone translation layer, undermining the efficiency gains promised by digital financial tools and preventing users from leveraging accurate data for informed budgeting and financial planning.

## Overview of Solution

This capstone project proposes the design and development of an intelligent transaction classification and workflow enhancement tool specifically for Beancount users. The solution will function as an AI-augmented assistant, seamlessly integrating into the existing user workflow to automate the most tedious and error-prone step: categorizing raw transaction descriptions into correct Beancount accounting accounts. The system will comprise three synergistic modules. First, an intelligent classification engine will leverage the semantic understanding capabilities of a large language model (LLM). Through carefully engineered prompts and a configurable rule base, this engine will analyze payee strings and memos, proposing the most likely Beancount account from the user’s custom chart of accounts, such as correctly identifying a "Meituan Grocery" charge as "Expenses:Food:Groceries." Second, an interactive web application will provide a user-friendly interface. Users can upload their bank-generated CSV files, review the system's classification suggestions along with confidence scores, and make corrections or establish new rules with simple clicks. This feedback will be captured in a local, persistent knowledge base, enabling the system to learn from user input and improve its accuracy over time, embodying principles of interactive machine learning. This approach aligns with emerging Human-AI collaboration frameworks in financial technology, such collaborative systems effectively mitigate algorithmic decision noise and improve reliability in FinTech applications, supporting our design choice for transparent user oversight (Sachan et al., 2024). Finally, a seamless output and integration module will transform the verified data. It will generate properly formatted Beancount journal entries, ready to be appended to the user’s main ledger file, and produce a basic visual dashboard summarizing spending categories, thereby closing the loop from raw data to immediate financial insight. This tool aligns with emerging trends in human-AI collaboration for personal productivity, as noted in recent literature on AI-powered assistants (Shneiderman, 2020).

## Specific Learning Objectives

This project is designed to comprehensively demonstrate the competencies outlined in the MSIT Program Learning Outcomes. For PLO 1, applying IT and computer science principles to analyze complex problems, the project requires a deep analysis of the semantic gap between transactional data and accounting semantics, a problem spanning natural language processing, data modeling, and human-computer interaction. The solution design and evaluation for PLO 2 will be evidenced through the implementation of a full-stack application using emerging technologies like LLM APIs and modern web frameworks, followed by rigorous testing against accuracy and efficiency metrics. Addressing PLO 3, analyzing user needs, will involve creating user personas for Beancount practitioners, conducting a task analysis of the current manual categorization process, and designing an intuitive interface that reduces cognitive load, ensuring the solution is user centered. The critical assessment of ethical considerations for PLO 4 will be a cornerstone of the project. This will involve a detailed discussion on data security and privacy, advocating for and implementing a local-first data processing architecture to ensure sensitive financial data never leaves the user's control. Furthermore, the project will scrutinize algorithmic bias, considering how the classifier might systematically misinterpret transactions from underrepresented merchants or cultural contexts, and design transparent correction mechanisms to mitigate such risks. Finally, for PLO 5, constructing evidence-based arguments, the implementation report will present quantitative data comparing pre- and post-tool adoption metrics, such as time spent per 100 transactions and classification accuracy rates, alongside references to scholarly work on the efficacy of AI in automating repetitive cognitive tasks to substantiate the project's value proposition.
